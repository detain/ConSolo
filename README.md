## from ROMs to Installed Populated Emulators and Frontends in less than 12 parsecs!

Scrape Emulator/Rom/Platform/etc Info from Multiple Sources (No-Intro, TOSEC, Redump, MAME, GamesDb, etc) and Intelligently matchs up your media to figure out what you have and writes out configuration files for various Frontends/Emulators/Tools such as LaunchBox/HyperSpin/RocketLauncher/RetroArch/MAMEUI/etc. It maintains a list of most emulators and how to use each one allowing automated/quick installs of 1 to every emulator/rom tool. Pluggable/Extensible architecture and a central repo of user submitted plugins.

Currently its a mass of scripts loosely tied together and development will be focused on a clean interface. Several UI's are planned although too soon to tell if they'll ever get finished. A web-ui which works the same but incorperates browser-based emulators.
