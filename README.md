from ROMs to Installed Populated Emulators and Frontends in under 12 parsecs!

Scrape Emulator/Rom/Platform/etc Info from Multiple Sources (No-Intro, TOSEC, Redump, MAME, GamesDb, etc) and Intelligently matchs up your media to figure out what you have and writes out configuration files for various Frontends/Emulators/Tools such as LaunchBox/HyperSpin/RocketLauncher/RetroArch/MAMEUI/etc. It maintains a list of most emulators and how to use each one allowing automated/quick installs of 1 to every emulator/rom tool. Pluggable/Extensible architecture and a central repo of user submitted plugins.

Currently its a mass of scripts loosely tied together and development will be focused on a clean interface. Several UI's are planned although too soon to tell if they'll ever get finished. A web-ui which works the same but incorperates browser-based emulators.

- [detain/emurelation](https://github.com/detain/emurelation): Emuâ¬…reâž¡lation is project with 1 simple purpose; to provide a mapping in JSON format of platforms accross different sources. There are several varied naming conventions used and many different programs and sites and this aims to allow you an easy way to convert or map the data from one type to another. It will eventually expand to include emulators, games, etc; but for now the initial focus is simply platform matching accross all sources.
