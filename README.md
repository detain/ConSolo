from ROMs to Installed Populated Emulators and Frontends in under 12 parsecs!

Scrape Emulator/Rom/Platform/etc Info from Multiple Sources (No-Intro, TOSEC, Redump, MAME, GamesDb, etc) and Intelligently matchs up your media to figure out what you have and writes out configuration files for various Frontends/Emulators/Tools such as LaunchBox/HyperSpin/RocketLauncher/RetroArch/MAMEUI/etc. It maintains a list of most emulators and how to use each one allowing automated/quick installs of 1 to every emulator/rom tool. Pluggable/Extensible architecture and a central repo of user submitted plugins.

Currently its a mass of scripts loosely tied together and development will be focused on a clean interface. Several UI's are planned although too soon to tell if they'll ever get finished. A web-ui which works the same but incorperates browser-based emulators.

### Dev Workspace

- Main list of platforms should come from sources that supply the actual games/roms to ensure we have whats needed without going too overboard:
  - No-Intro
  - TOSEC
  - Redump
  - MAME
- Types to match between sources:
  - Manufacturers
  - Platforms
  - Emulators
  - Games
- each Type will have (* required):
  - id*
  - name*
  - shortName (dirname)
  - description
  - altNames[]
  - images<url,type>
  - urls<url, name>
- local repo will also have this type:
  - Matches<source,id>
